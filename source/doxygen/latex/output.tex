The following output formats are {\itshape directly} supported by doxygen\+: 
\begin{DoxyDescription}
\item[{\bfseries{H\+T\+ML}} ]Generated if G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+H\+T\+ML is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} in the configuration file. 
\item[(\{\}) ]Generated if G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+L\+A\+T\+EX is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} in the configuration file. 
\item[{\bfseries{Man pages}} ]Generated if G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+M\+AN is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} in the configuration file. 
\item[{\bfseries{R\+TF}} ]Generated if G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+R\+TF is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} in the configuration file.

Note that the R\+TF output probably only looks nice with Microsoft\textquotesingle{}s Word. If you have success with other programs, please let me know. 
\item[{\bfseries{X\+ML}} ]Generated if G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+X\+ML is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} in the configuration file.


\item[{\bfseries{Doc\+Book}} ]Generated if G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+D\+O\+C\+B\+O\+OK is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} in the configuration file.

The following output formats are {\itshape indirectly} supported by doxygen\+: 
\begin{DoxyDescription}
\item[{\bfseries{Compiled H\+T\+ML Help}} (a.\+k.\+a. Windows 98 help) ]Generated by Microsoft\textquotesingle{}s H\+T\+ML Help workshop from the H\+T\+ML output if G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+H\+T\+M\+L\+H\+E\+LP is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES}. 
\item[{\bfseries{Qt Compressed Help (.qch)}} ]Generated by Qt\textquotesingle{}s qhelpgenerator tool from the H\+T\+ML output if G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+Q\+HP is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES}. 
\item[{\bfseries{Eclipse Help}} ]Generated from H\+T\+ML with a special index file that is generated when G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+E\+C\+L\+I\+P\+S\+E\+H\+E\+LP is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES}. 
\item[{\bfseries{X\+Code Doc\+Sets}} ]Compiled from H\+T\+ML with a special index file that is generated when G\+E\+N\+E\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+D\+O\+C\+S\+ET is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES}. 
\item[{\bfseries{Post\+Script}} ]Generated from the \textbackslash{}f(\{\textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX\}\textbackslash{}f) output by running {\ttfamily make ps} in the output directory. For the best results P\+D\+F\+\_\+\+H\+Y\+P\+E\+R\+L\+I\+N\+KS should be set to {\ttfamily NO}. 
\item[{\bfseries{P\+DF}} ]Generated from the \textbackslash{}f(\{\textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX\}\textbackslash{}f) output by running {\ttfamily make pdf} in the output directory. To improve the P\+DF output, you typically would want to enable the use of {\ttfamily pdflatex} by setting U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+P\+D\+F\+L\+A\+T\+EX to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} in the configuration file. In order to get hyperlinks in the P\+DF file you also need to enable P\+D\+F\+\_\+\+H\+Y\+P\+E\+R\+L\+I\+N\+KS.
