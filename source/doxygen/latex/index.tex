\doxysubsection*{Introduction}

Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-\/C, C\#, P\+HP, Java, Python, I\+DL (Corba, Microsoft, and U\+N\+O/\+Open\+Office flavors), Fortran, and to some extent D. Doxygen also supports the hardware description language V\+H\+DL.

Doxygen can help you in three ways\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item It can generate an on-\/line documentation browser (in H\+T\+ML) and/or an off-\/line reference manual (in \textbackslash{}f(\{\textbackslash{}\+La\+TeX\}\textbackslash{}f)) from a set of documented source files. There is also support for generating output in R\+TF (M\+S-\/\+Word), Post\+Script, hyperlinked P\+DF, compressed H\+T\+ML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code. 
\item You can \mbox{\hyperlink{starting_extract_all}{configure}} doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented source files. This is very useful to quickly find your way in large source distributions. Doxygen can also visualize the relations between the various elements by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically. 
\item You can also use doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I did for the doxygen user manual and web-\/site). 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Doxygen is developed under Mac OS X and Linux, but is set-\/up to be highly portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. Furthermore, executables for Windows are available.

This manual is divided into three parts, each of which is divided into several sections.

The first part forms a user manual\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{install}{Installation}} discusses how to \href{https://www.doxygen.org/download.html}{\texttt{ download}}, compile and install doxygen for your platform. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{starting}{Getting started}} tells you how to generate your first piece of documentation quickly. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{docblocks}{Documenting the code}} demonstrates the various ways that code can be documented. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{markdown}{Markdown support}} show the Markdown formatting supported by doxygen. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{lists}{Lists}} shows how to create lists. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{grouping}{Grouping}} shows how to group things together. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{tables}{Including tables}} shows how to insert tables in the documentation. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{formulas}{Including formulas}} shows how to insert formulas in the documentation. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{diagrams}{Graphs and diagrams}} describes the diagrams and graphs that doxygen can generate. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{preprocessing}{Preprocessing}} explains how doxygen deals with macro definitions. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{autolink}{Automatic link generation}} shows how to put links to files, classes, and members in the documentation. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{output}{Output Formats}} shows how to generate the various output formats supported by doxygen. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{searching}{Searching}} shows various ways to search in the H\+T\+ML documentation. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{extsearch}{External Indexing and Searching}} shows how use the external search and index tools 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{customize}{Customizing the output}} explains how you can customize the output generated by doxygen. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{custcmd}{Custom Commands}} show how to define and use custom commands in your comments. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{external}{Linking to external documentation}} explains how to let doxygen create links to externally generated documentation. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{faq}{Frequently Asked Questions}} gives answers to frequently asked questions. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{trouble}{Troubleshooting}} tells you what to do when you have problems. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The second part forms a reference manual\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{features}{Features}} presents an overview of what doxygen can do. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{doxygen_usage}{Doxygen usage}} shows how to use the {\ttfamily doxygen} program. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{doxywizard_usage}{Doxywizard usage}} shows how to use the {\ttfamily doxywizard} program. 
\item Section config shows how to fine-\/tune doxygen, so it generates the documentation you want. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{commands}{Special Commands}} shows an overview of the special commands that can be used within the documentation. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{htmlcmds}{H\+T\+ML Commands}} shows an overview of the H\+T\+ML commands that can be used within the documentation. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{xmlcmds}{X\+ML Commands}} shows an overview of the C\# style X\+ML commands that can be used within the documentation. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{emojisup}{Emoji support}} shows an introduction how emoji can be used within the documentation. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The third part provides information for developers\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{arch}{Doxygen\textquotesingle{}s Internals}} gives a global overview of how doxygen is internally structured. 
\item Section \mbox{\hyperlink{perlmod}{Perl Module Output}} shows how to use the Perl\+Mod output. 
\item Section langhowto explains how to add support for new output languages. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{User examples}

Doxygen supports a number of \mbox{\hyperlink{output}{output formats}} where H\+T\+ML is the most popular one. I\textquotesingle{}ve gathered \href{https://www.doxygen.org/results.html}{\texttt{ some nice examples}} of real-\/life projects using doxygen.

These are part of a larger \href{https://www.doxygen.org/projects.html}{\texttt{ list of projects}} that use doxygen. If you know other projects, let \href{mailto:doxygen@gmail.com?subject=New\%20project\%20using\%20Doxygen}{\texttt{ me}} know and I\textquotesingle{}ll add them.

\doxysubsection*{Future work}

Although doxygen is successfully used by large number of companies and open source projects already, there is always room for improvement. 

You can also submit enhancement requests in \href{https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues}{\texttt{ the bug tracker}}.
